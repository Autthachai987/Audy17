# Parts of a Car

## Engine Components
- **Engine Block**: The main structure of the engine, housing the cylinders and other components.
- **Pistons**: Move up and down within the cylinders, converting fuel into mechanical energy.
- **Crankshaft**: Converts the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion.

## Transmission Parts
- **Transmission**: Transfers power from the engine to the wheels.
- **Clutch**: Engages and disengages the engine from the transmission.
- **Gearbox**: Contains gears that adjust the torque and speed of the vehicle.
